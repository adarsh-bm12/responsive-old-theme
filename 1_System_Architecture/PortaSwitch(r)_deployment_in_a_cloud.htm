    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="_Toc59709052"></a>PortaSwitch® deployment in a cloud</h2>
    <p>PortaOne introduces the concept of PortaSwitch® as a cloud-based solution. With this solution, you do not need to purchase hardware servers and/or spend time and effort on their maintenance. Instead, you decide upon the processing capacity you require
      for your business, submit your request to the PortaOne Sales team and then receive a scalable, ready-to-use platform that operates in a cloud. Thus you start your business faster and speed up your payback.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><img alt="cloud architecture" src="../assets/images/PortaSwitch_Concepts_MR89-01-AD_files/image19.png" data-rhwidget="Basic" data-popupimage="../assets/images/PortaSwitch_Concepts_MR89-01-AD_files/image19.png" class="popup-image-thumbnail" width="750"/></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The key features of the cloud-based PortaSwitch® solution are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Near-zero CAPEX and reduced OPEX – By deploying PortaSwitch® in a cloud, you save on hardware purchases and provisioning. The cloud infrastructure is maintained by PortaOne, which drastically reduces the load on your administrative staff.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Reduced deployment time – You receive the platform, ready-to-use, within a day.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Flexible scalability – The processing capacity can be increased/decreased on demand.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Cloud pricing – The cloud-based PortaSwitch® solution does not assume licensing. The pricing consists of a one-time set-up fee and then a recurring subscription fee that is formulated based on the number of billable xDRs processed per month. Customers
          interested in migrating their existing deployments to a cloud will be eligible for commercial incentives.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The cloud-based PortaSwitch® platform is the solution for businesses of all sizes. Due to a reduction in deployment charges, small telcos and startups can use it to enter the telecommunications market. Large ITSPs can also use PortaSwitch® to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Deploy a new installation (site) in another region/country to introduce geo-redundancy and perform software upgrades with zero down-time;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Gradually move active customers to new installations using the Porter data transfer tool and thereby introduce a Dual Version of PortaSwitch®. (For more information, please read the <a class="Hyperlink" href="../4_Dual_Version_PortaSwitch®/Concept_of_Dual_Version_PortaSwitch®.htm">Dual Version PortaSwitch®</a>          chapter);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Quickly deploy a staging system to verify new functionalities or interoperability with third-party equipment.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>With PortaSwitch® deployed in a cloud, you have advanced flexibility in managing your network infrastructure. Even with reduced deployment budgets, businesses of all sizes can become active players in the telecommunications market.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3"><a id="Site-to-site_VPN_for_PortaSwitch_deployed_on_the_premises_and_in_the_cloud"></a>Site-to-site VPN for PortaSwitch® deployed on the premises and in the cloud</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to deploy PortaSwitch®: on the premises on hardware servers, in a cloud or as a combination of both (e.g. you disperse PortaSwitch® across multiple sites for redundancy or deploy a Dual Version PortaSwitch® for gradual customer
      migration).</p>
    <p>For PortaSwitch® installations deployed both in a cloud and on the premises, a reliable and secure interconnection must be established between these two locations. In practice, this means building a VPN that combines networks from both the cloud infrastructure
      and the on-premises datacenter. Typically, site-to-site VPNs use tunnels to encapsulate data packets within normal IP packets and forward them over public IP-based networks, using encryption to ensure privacy.</p>
    <p>The configuration of such a tunnel involves the following:</p>
    <ol class="List53">
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">set up a VPN endpoint within a cloud network;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">set up a VPN endpoint within an on-premises network;</p>
      </li>
      <li>make sure that both VPN endpoints freely exchange TCP/UDP traffic on ports 500 (ISAKMP) and 4500 (NAT traversal);</li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">enable a tunnel between the two VPN endpoints and check the connectivity.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="Heading4"><a id="VPN_endpoint_in_a_cloud_network"></a>VPN endpoint in a cloud network</h4>
    <p>To set up a VPN endpoint in a PortaSwitch® cloud network, submit a request to the PortaOne Support team. The request must include the following information:</p>
    <ul class="List41" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">a public IPv4 address for a VPN endpoint located on the premises;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">the IP address of the private on-premises network that will be added to the VPN.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a VPN endpoint in a PortaSwitch® cloud network is configured, you are provided with its public IPv4 address, pre-shared key and a private cloud network address.</p>
    <h4 class="Heading4"><a id="VPN_endpoint_in_the_on-premises_network"></a>VPN endpoint in the on-premises network</h4>
    <p>To set up a VPN endpoint in the on-premises network, either a VPN-capable device or software-based router is required (both must support standard-based IPSec encryption). Such a device/software router must be placed in the on-premises network and
      have a public IPv4 address assigned to it. It must also comply with the following ISAKMP policy options:</p>
    <ul class="List50" data-start="1.1" xmlns="">
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">ISAKMP protocol, version 1;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">exchange type: main mode;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">authentication method: pre-shared keys;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">encryption algorithms: AES-128-cbc, AES-192-cbc, AES-256-cbc;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">authentication algorithm: SHA1 (also called SHA or SHA1-96), SHA-256, SHA-384;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Diffie-Hellman group: group 1, group 2, group 5; and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">IKE session key lifetime: 28800 seconds (8 hours).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, support of the following IPSec policy options is required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">IPSec protocol: ESP, tunnel-mode;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">encryption: AES-128-cbc, AES-192-cbc, AES-256-cbc;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">authentication algorithm: HMAC-SHA1-96;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">IPSec session key lifetime: 3600 seconds (1 hour); and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): enabled, group 5.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please refer to <a class="Hyperlink" href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/configuringCPE.htm" target="_blank">https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/configuringCPE.htm</a> for useful details about a particular
      VPN endpoint configuration.</p>
    <h4 class="Heading4"><a id="Enable_a_tunnel_between_VPN_endpoints"></a>Enable a tunnel between VPN endpoints</h4>
    <p>Provision the public IPv4 address, pre-shared key and private cloud network address of the VPN endpoint configured in the cloud onto an on-premises device (or software router) so that a tunnel between the two VPN endpoints can be established.</p>
